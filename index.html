            Asher Web Design Studio is not your average team of web developers.
            Smaller than our rivals, we see ourselves as problem solvers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Websites, in our opinion, are just business tools. The problem we
            solve is by making your website the most effective tool for your
            business.
          </p>
          <p>
            We create a website that serves both your existing customers and
            attracts new leads.
          </p>
          <p>
            We know what it takes to convert a visitor into a customer, we
            believe that the Buy-button is in the brain.

      <article class="about">
        <p>
          Asher Zahid first fell in love with the art of programming when he was
          young. Growing up, he was more fascinated with how video games were
          made, than actually playing them. He was still at school when he took
          his first foray into the world of programming and hasn’t looked back
          since.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the time he reached Grade 4, he had already programmed his first
          game. While he was studying for his Bachelor’s in IT and Master’s in
          Business Education, he gained a lot of experience by completing
          freelance work for clients from all over the world.
